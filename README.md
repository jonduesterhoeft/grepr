A minimal version of grep implemented in Rust.

# Overview #
**grepr** is a simple command line search tool. A search string and 
file path are input as arguments, along with several optionals 
to fine tune the search. The program iterates through each line in the
specified file and will return any lines matching the search criteria.

Optional arguments are shown via the --help flag.

are ignored.
```console
$ grepr "in" tests/pale_blue_dot.txt -w

```console
$ grepr a tests/pale_blue_dot.txt -v

test/pale_blue_dot.txt

10: the history of our species lived there--
